# Compiler
A simple compiler for the **C** programming language

I've recently starting reading up on compiler theory and decided to write a compile for the **C** language.
The compiler currently supports opening and compiling just one file into the target architecture.
This project will be continuously updated till it turns to a full fledged program.
